    <h2>This weekend's special brunch</h2>
        <p>This weekend, our season of special brunches continues with scrambled egg on an English muffin.
        Not for the faint-hearted, the secret to these eggs is that they are made with half cream
        and cooked in butter, with no more than four eggs in the pan at a time.</p>
